#Siglot: Signal and Slots made simpler for everyone

Siglot is an easy to read/understand, standalone, single-header, STL-only, C++11 implementation of Signals and Slots.

### About

I started this little project to prove that Signals and Slots could be implemented easily and efficiently in C++11 without calling heavy libraries like Qt, Boost or complicated headers like FastDelegates. I think I reached a satisfactory result with a clean header less than 300 lines long, and STL-only.

### Bug reports

Please send bug reports with minimal examples to the address displayed in the header preamble. The plus sign in the e-mail is a real plus sign (I know, it's not common).
